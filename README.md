This repo contains solutions to a majority of the end of the section/chapter problems and quizzes from http://www.learncpp.com/.
Some of the problems were developed in a Windows enviroment using Visual Studio, while others, especially the later ones,
were developed in a Linux enviroment.

This repo also contains some basic examples of how to use the MPI and FFTW libraries.
